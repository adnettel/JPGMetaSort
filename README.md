# JPGMetaSort
Extracts creation dates from jpg files, sorts based on dates, renames files in order starting at 000000.jpg

The inspiration for this simple program came from an app that I use that produces timelapses from pictures taken every day.
When backing up these images, iOS decided that the creation date did not need to be preserved, causing all of them to be out
of order. This program fixes that.
